# ClrBasics

Provides optimized and specialized versions of String and ToLookup.

This project provides a few compact string classes optimized for short strings. This can be very useful to
reduce garbage collection duration/pause when storing millions of relatively short strings.

Finally, it provides hardware-specific optimized versions of some arithmetic operations which are
important for the speed of some algorithms and libraries.

## Benchmarks

These numbers are from an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU         930  @ 2.80GHz.
They are run under .NET 4.6 in x64 mode.

## TODO
- Usability: Efficient, transparent runtime checks for whether to use optimized version. OK
- Stability: Support x86. OK
- Stability: Perform intel cpu feature checks. OK
- Stability: Perform cpu feature checks. OK
- String15: CompareTo, it seems, is not correct. OK
- String15: Serialization support. What can be made to work decently: binaryformatter, xml... OK
- String15Ex: Make comparison and equality work. OK

- Stability: Skip code replacement on environments which it might not work on: NGEN, arm, non-windows...
- String15: utf8 string with accelerated operations.


- ArrayLookup: Clone/modify.



## Serialization

Serialization with BinaryFormatter and XmlSerializer works.
